4. VPN Research Summary
How VPNs Work:
A VPN (Virtual Private Network) functions by encrypting internet traffic and routing it through a secure server. This process hides the user's real IP address, ensuring that online activities are private and protected from surveillance.

Encryption & Privacy Features of ProtonVPN:
Encryption Standard: Uses AES-256 encryption for securing data.

No-Log Policy: ProtonVPN does not log or track user activities, ensuring complete privacy.

DNS Leak Protection: Prevents DNS queries from leaking outside the secure tunnel.

Kill Switch (premium feature): Protects the user by stopping all internet traffic in case the VPN connection drops unexpectedly.

5. Benefits of VPNs
Privacy Protection: VPNs protect your identity by masking your IP address.

Enhanced Security: Encryption helps safeguard data from hackers and malicious third parties.

Access to Geo-blocked Content: Allows users to bypass geo-restrictions and censorship to access restricted websites and services.

Secure Browsing on Public Wi-Fi: Encrypts traffic on public networks, making it safer to use Wi-Fi in cafes, airports, etc.

Reduced Tracking: Decreases the ability of websites to track users and serve targeted ads.

6. Limitations of VPNs
Slower Internet Speed: VPNs can cause a slight reduction in browsing speed due to the extra encryption layer.

Free Tier Limitations: The free version of ProtonVPN provides fewer server locations and limited bandwidth compared to the premium version.

Not a Full Security Solution: While VPNs protect privacy, they do not protect against malware, phishing, or other online threats.

Blocked VPNs: Some websites or services may block known VPN IPs, which can prevent access to certain content.

Conclusion
Setting up ProtonVPN has provided valuable insight into the importance of VPNs for privacy and secure communication. Although they are effective tools for protecting user data, itâ€™s essential to combine them with other security measures, such as using strong passwords and being cautious with browser extensions, to maintain a high level of online safety.
